 Question 1: YouTube Video Quality Selection
 Scenario: A user is watching a YouTube video and the platform must select the appropriate video quality
 based on two conditions: - Internet speed - Whether the user selected "Auto" mode or manual mode.
 ðŸ’¡ Logic Steps
 : - Ask if the user selected "Auto" or "Manual" mode. - If "Auto": - If internet speed > 10 Mbps
 â†’ Play 1080p - Else if speed > 5 Mbps â†’ Play 720p - Else if speed > 2 Mbps â†’ Play 480p - Else â†’ Play 240p 
If "Manual": - Ask for selected quality (e.g., 240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) - Play the selected quality
 Expected Understanding: Learn to handle multiple nested conditions and simulate real-time
 decision logic.

elif mode == "Manual":

    if quality == "240p" or quality == "480p" or quality == "720p" or quality == "1080p":
        print("Manual Mode: Playing video at", quality)
    else:

else:
    print("Invalid mode selected. Please choose either 'Auto' or 'Manual'.")
