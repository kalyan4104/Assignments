                           Python For Loops

1. Print each character of a string.
Explanation: Use a for loop to iterate through each character in a string sequence.


for i in "kalyan" :
    print(i)


2. Print all even numbers from a list.
Explanation: Iterate through a list and use a condition to check for even numbers.


xyz = [1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 16, 19,20]

for i in xyz :
    
    if i%2 == 0:
        print(i)

3. Calculate the sum of numbers in a tuple.
Explanation: Use a for loop to iterate through a tuple and keep adding each number to a total variable.


abc = (1,2,3,4,5)
sum = 0

for i in abc:
    
    sum+=i
    
print ("total sum of elements in tuple",sum)


4. Print names from a list of strings.
Explanation: Loop through a list of names and print each one.


names = ["kalyan", "krishna", "ntr", "prabhas","ram"]

for i in names:
    print(i)


5. Print square of numbers using range.
Explanation: Use range to generate numbers, then square each number inside the loop.


for i in range(1,10):
    print(i*i)


6. Count vowels in a string.
Explanation: Loop through each character and check if it is a vowel using a condition.


vowel_count = 0
for i in "house":
    if i in ["a","e","i","o","u"] :
        vowel_count+=1
        
print("total no.of vowels",vowel_count)
